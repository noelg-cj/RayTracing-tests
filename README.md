# Ray Tracing Tests

Ray Tracing is the algorithm for calculating the lighting by sending individual rays from each pixel on the camera and getting the color of the pixel by use of accurate light bounces.
This repository is used to experiment with raytracing algorithms based on the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book and RayTracing Series by The Cherno
